🚀 Swin Transformer + Grey Wolf Optimization + Faster R‑CNN
<p align="center"> <img src="outputs/output2.jpg/bacterialspot1" width="600"/> </p>
🔍 An end‑to‑end deep learning system that not only identifies leaf diseases, but also locates infected regions, estimates severity, and predicts leaf lifespan.

✨ Why This Project is Special
✅ Vision Transformer–based classification
🐺 Meta‑heuristic optimization (GWO)
📦 Accurate region‑level localization
📊 Severity analysis
⏳ Lifespan estimation
🧠 Explainable & practical agricultural AI

🧠 Problem Statement
Manual detection of plant diseases is:
>Time‑consuming
>Error‑prone
>Not scalable

This project automates:
✔ Disease identification
✔ Infected region localization
✔ Severity measurement
✔ Decision‑support via lifespan prediction
